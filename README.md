## Branches

There are different branches or "versions" of this mod. Texture wise, they are all _identical_ and up-to-date, unless otherwise stated.

### main

The main branch of the mod. There is nothing more to say.

### Dev

**LIKELY UNSTABLE OR NONFUNCTIONAL**<br>
The development branch.<br>
Called `JsTexturesDev` internally.

### No Depencencies/Raw

A version of the mod without SkinModHelper+ intergration, instead overriding the game textures directly.<br>
Called `JsTexturesRaw` internally.
