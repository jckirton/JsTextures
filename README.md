## Description

This is the Celeste texture mod I made, which can be found on GameBanana [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/251782).
<br>Please post any issues and feature requests both here _and_ on the GameBanana page.

## Installation

You can download the mod from the [GameBanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/251782), or though [Olympus](https://everest.github.io).

## Branches

There are different branches or "versions" of this mod. Texture wise, they are all _identical_ and up-to-date, unless otherwise stated.

### Main

The main branch of the mod. There is nothing more to say.

### No Depencencies/Raw

A version of the mod without SkinModHelper+ intergration, instead overriding the game textures directly.
<br>Called `JsTexturesRaw` internally.
